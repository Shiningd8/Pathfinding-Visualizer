# Pathfinding-Visualizer

A C++ project that visualizes pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's) on a grid. Users can interactively place start and end points, add obstacles, and watch the algorithms find the shortest path.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Place start, end, and obstacles with keyboard clicks.
- **Multiple Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores all possible paths (not guaranteed to be shortest).
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path in a weighted grid.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithms explore the grid step by step.
- **No External Libraries**: Built entirely in C++ using standard libraries.
Below are the example of the outputs for every algorithm used.
