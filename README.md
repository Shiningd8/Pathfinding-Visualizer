# Pathfinding-Visualizer
A C++ project that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's) on a grid. Users can interactively place start and end points, add obstacles, and watch the algorithms find the shortest path. This project is built entirely in C++ without any external libraries, making it lightweight and easy to understand.
